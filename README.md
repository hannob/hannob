I am [Hanno BÃ¶ck](https://hboeck.de/), a freelance journalist and IT security
professional.

I am passionate about free and open source software, and have created a number of open
source security tools.

# security tools

I am currently primarily working on [badkeys](https://badkeys.info/), a tool to detect
cryptographic public keys with known vulnerabilities. Its code can be found [here](
https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys).

with known vulnerabilities.
